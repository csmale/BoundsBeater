# regex replacements to normalise boundary names
# NB: the input has already been lower-cased, so all strings in this file should be in LC
# lines are of the form:
#  <regex>|<replacement>
# to use a pipe character in either string, use a backslash to escape it, i.e. \|
# lines are applied in order!
# spaces (including leading and trailing) are significant in this file!
# the final result has multiple spaces replaced with single spaces, and leading and trailing spaces removed.
# blank lines, and lines starting with #, are ignored
